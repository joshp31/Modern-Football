A big question in professional football is "When did 'Modern Football'" start. In these spreadsheets I seek to answer this question simply by analyzing yearly NFL stats. Answering this question will aid me in how I analyze and look at NFL statistics in the future. The conclusion that I drew from this project is that "Modern Football" began in 2008.
